##### Cormac Dacker, 2024

## Introduction

Submarines have been a staple of naval warfare since the American Civil War, but it wasn't until the World Wars that
they became a major player in the world's navies. The German U-Boats, in particular, were a major threat to Allied
shipping during both World Wars. In this project, I will analyze the longevity of U-Boats in the World Wars, focusing on
the factors that contributed to their survival or destruction.
